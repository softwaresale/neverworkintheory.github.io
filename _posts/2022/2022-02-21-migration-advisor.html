  <p>
    In the spirit of <i>not</i> reinventing the wheel, most software projects
    rely on third party libraries to provide functionality critical to the project.
    Sometimes, these dependencies are abandoned by their maintainers, which makes
    them unsuitable for future use. In this event, the developer is forced to switch
    to a new library that has similar functionality. This task is difficult as
    there are often multiple options to choose from, and there are no metrics to
    evaluate how good of a replacement a project is.

    Enter <cite>He2021</cite>'s tool <a href="http://migration-helper.net/#/"><b>MigrationAdvisor</b></a>.
    This website aids in the library migration decision-making process. It uses
    data mined from open source software projects to suggest replacements for
    Java libraries. The metrics measure things like frequently added/removed libraries,
    libraries that were explicitly stated to be a mirgration, changes to library
    calls, and commit topology.

    <b>MigrationAdvisor</b> is evaluated on its correctness and its helpfulness.
    Its correctness is measured using Mean Reciprocal Rank (a common metric for
    evaluating retrieval and ranking problems). The tool outperforms the existing
    tools for library migration by scoring an MRR of 0.8566. Additionally,
    <b>MigrationAdvisor</b>'s helpfulness is evaluated by peer professional
    developers who all say that the tool is overall useful in the library migration
    process.

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    During software maintenance, developers may need
    to migrate an already in-use library to another library with
    similar functionalities. However, it is difficult to make the
    optimal migration decision with limited information, knowledge,
    or expertise. In this paper, we present MIGRATIONADVISOR,
    an evidence-based tool to recommend library migration targets
    through intelligent analysis upon a large number of GitHub
    repositories and Java libraries. The migration advisories are provided through a search engine style web service where developers
    can seek migration suggestions for a specific library. We conduct
    systematic evaluations on the correctness of results, and evaluate
    the usefulness of the tool by collecting usage feedback from
    industry developers
